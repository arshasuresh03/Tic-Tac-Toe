A simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python

A simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python typically involves a grid representing the game board and two players who take turns marking spaces on the grid. Here's a brief description of how you can implement a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python:

1.	Setup the Game Board: Create a 3x3 grid to represent the Tic Tac Toe board. You can use a nested list or any other data structure to represent the grid.

2.	Display the Game Board: Write a function to display the current state of the game board after each move. This function will print out the grid with the current marks (e.g., 'X', 'O', or empty) in each cell.

3.	Player Input: Ask the players to input their moves. Each player takes turns entering the row and column where they want to place their mark ('X' or 'O') on the grid.

4.	Check for Win or Draw: After each move, check if there is a winner or if the game has ended in a draw. You need to check rows, columns, and diagonals to see if any player has three marks in a row.

5.	Switch Players: Alternate between players for each turn. Keep track of whose turn it is and switch accordingly.

6.	Repeat Until Game Over: Continue the game until one player wins or the board is full (draw). After each move, check if the game is over. If it is, display the winner or announce the draw.
